Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A1: Git initialize an empty repository (it creates the .git directory) but I
 still need to make the first commit to begin to track changes in the repository


Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

 What value do you think it offers?

A2: The staging area is an intermediate area used to add files and begin tracking changes of those files
It offers the possibility to add only those files that I want to add so that is possible to make ine commits per 
logical step
